# Authentication
## 1. Integrate the frontend with Auth0
Your task is to integrate the React app with Auth0 using the standard Auth0 logic and libraries. For this you'll create a ProtectedRoute component that will check in Auth0 if the user is logged in or not. If the user is not logged in, you'll redirect him to the Login page.

On the login page you'll create hooks to login with Auth0 and send the data the backend under the route /api/auth/login.
